Welcome in French gypsies world! You're Gandalf and your goal is to beat Joe Lopez, a famous french gypsy, by following quests and loot items on your ennemies!

## Q&A
<details>
  <summary>How this idea comes to your mind?</summary>
  We were just laughing about pop culture reference and we talked about Gypsies in France. So we decided to make a RPG in a gypsy world. Then, we told ourselves: "Why not implement some Sci-Fi characters?". We also implement Gandalf as our main character.
